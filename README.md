## **Cybersecurity Portfolio**



Welcome to my portfolio for cybersecurity. This is my project repository, including work I have done for cybersecurity. This includes penetration testing, incident response, and more. I consider this as my little fraction of cyberspace, encompassing what I am good at when it comes to securing systems and, most importantly, the data they hold.



## Projects



### 1. Penetration Testing Suite

â€¢ A wide assortment of web-focused penetration testing tools and scripts designed to check for vulnerabilities and assess the posture of target systems.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Bash, Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite

- **Repository Link:** [Penetration Testing Suite](https://github.com/username/penetration-testing-suite)



### 2. Threat Intelligence Dashboard

- A web-based dashboard that consolidates threat intelligence feeds into a single view, visualises them with maps and graphics, and supports cybersecurity operations with timely and relevant data.

- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB
